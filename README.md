[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-bridge-framework)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-bridge-framework)

## Description
The Bridge Framework is an integration framework deployed on SAP BTP that allows developers to quickly customize and deploy apps that bring the powerful business logic of SAP products to the convenience of Microsoft Teams.

The Bridge Framework supports integrating with SAP systems through BTP services that developers may already be familiar with: SAP Integration Suite, SAP Graph, and destination service. Simple object mapping configurations within the framework provide developers with the ability to access business objects through any of the supported services. The framework does not enforce limits on which services to use for which use case, so developers are free to decide which API works best for them based on their business needs. Furthermore, the Bridge Framework provides an out-of-the-box UI that is intuitive and easy to configure, all while adhering to the design and styling of Microsoft Teams.
