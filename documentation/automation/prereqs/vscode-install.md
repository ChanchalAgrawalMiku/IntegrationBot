# VSCode Installation

To install VSCode, head over to the [VSCode download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and select the version that works for your computer.

Now, the reason why we recommend using VSCode is because it offers a simple and easy way to remote into the Docker container. This provides a much more pleasant user experience when running the automated setup.

To enter your Docker container from VSCode, you will need to install the following VSCode extension: [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). If you are unfamiliar with how VSCode extensions work, please refer to [this detailed guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace) covering the VSCode extension marketplace.
