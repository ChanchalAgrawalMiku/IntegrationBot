# Docker Engine Installation

We strongly encourage the use of Docker Desktop for automated setup, as it offers a nice visual confirmation through its UI.

**Note:** you do not need a Docker account to use the automation pipeline, simply the engine!

[This page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) provides the download for Docker Desktop. Select the version that is compatible with your computer and enjoy!

If you would prefer to install just the engine, please refer to [this page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Once again, select the version that is compatible with your computer and enjoy!
